                        <h1>About Lexi</h1>

                        <p>Alexis Mareta Bellinger, known in reputable circles as The Coolest Person Who
                            Has Ever Lived was shepherded into this world, a cuddly chubby cherub on July
                            the 24th in the year of our Lord Nineteen Hundred and Ninety to Mark Douglas
                            and Bobbie Jean Bellinger.</p>
                        <p>Even as a small child, Alexis was fond of toast, books, and cats; her first
                            feline friend being a Turkish Angora named Angel. Her love of reading began
                            with The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein, a tear-jerker of the highest order.
                            She started writing as a wee one, scribbling bad adventure stories in spiral
                            notebooks.</p>
                        <p>In school, she studied communications and pre-med (Don’t ask. It’s a long, long,
                            long, long story.) But she has since given that up to pursue her childhood
                            dreams of being an author, an ibuprofen popping, watered-down-black-coffee
                            chugging author. </p>
                        <p>She lives in Chicago. When she isn’t reading, writing, or coding, she likes to
                            volunteer and watch ghost shows. </p>
